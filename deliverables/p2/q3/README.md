In this directory, you'll find a `.sql` file containing three `insert` commands.
You'll also find a file `simulatedata.py` that inserts much random data to populate the database.
This folder also contains `proof.png` a picture of the output of `SELECT * FROM person`, as proof
of the insert commands and scripts.
