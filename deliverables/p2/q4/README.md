As per question 4, this directory contains proof that we've populated the database with data for later querying and manipulation.

This folder contains files `all_tables.png` and `table_00.png` through `table_16.png`.
`all_tables` uses the `\d` command to show all relations, and all the other images
show the outupt of `select * from tablename limit 7`.
